        <div>Hi, I,m Lexi! </div>
        <div><b>Birthday:</b> January 14, 2015.</div>
        <div><b>Place of Birth</b> New York, U.S.A.</div>
        <div><b>Age:</b>5 years old. </div>
        <div><b>Human Mom:</b> Ytzel Flores </div>
        <div><b>Favorite things:</b> My rabit teddy and bite and give kisses at the same time. </div>
        <div><b>I hate:</b> When humans don't give me new food even if I have some in my bowl and Patucha. </div>
        <div><b>A little about me:</b> Everyone call me "Malefic" because I like to bite them but that's how I get fun. I sleep next to my human mom and when I want to get out I climb to her chest and cry. Everyone do what I want. I hate Patucha since she come, I like to climb to a chair and hit her when she pass by. </div>
