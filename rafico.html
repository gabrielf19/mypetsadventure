        <div>Hi, I,m Rafico! </div>
        <div><b>Birthday:</b> July 21, 2011. </div>
        <div><b>Died:</b> April 10, 2020</div> 
        <div><b>Place of Birth:</b> Guayaquil, Ecuador. </div>
        <div><b>Age:</b> 8 years old. </div>
        <div><b>Human Dad and Mom:</b> Roberto Flores and Guadalupe Cristiansen. </div>
        <div><b>Favorite things:</b> Was food and my human mom. </div> 
        <div><b>I hate:</b> Saw my bowl empty and that my mom left me outside of her room.</div>
        <div><b>A little about me:</b>I loved to eat a lot that's why I was fluffy. My human mom was my favorite thing, I was always at her side, she made my voice to talk with humans. I always cried at my mom's door at 5 a.m so she could fill my bowl. I died but I will remember that I had a great life. Btw: I died in New York next to my humans which is cool.  </div>
